# nlp_final_project

The project is based on interviews of depressed/not depressed people. The data we used congtains 56 train interviews and 14 test interviews. We decided to use only the transcriptions of participants and not the interviewer to keep the data clean. We used different labels(depressed/not depressed, tired/not tired, self-identifying depressed/self-identifying not depressed and gender) for broader, deeper analysis. We used multiple techniques (Word2Vec, LDA, NER etc.) which are analyzed separately later in the project. We also created a model to predict whether the person is depressed or not.

The project is based on Gratch J, Artstein R, Lucas GM, Stratou G, Scherer S, Nazarian A, Wood R, Boberg J, DeVault D, Marsella S, Traum DR. The Distress Analysis Interview Corpus of human and computer interviews. InLREC 2014 May (pp. 3123-3128)
